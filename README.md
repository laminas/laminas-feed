# laminas-feed

`Laminas\Feed` provides functionality for consuming RSS and Atom feeds. It provides
a natural syntax for accessing elements of feeds, feed attributes, and entry
attributes. `Laminas\Feed` also has extensive support for modifying feed and entry
structure with the same natural syntax, and turning the result back into XML.
